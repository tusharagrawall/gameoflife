Hey fellas!
This is Conway's Game of Life written in JAVA Processing.
-Processing is an open-source low level animation and GUI library built on Java with additional simplifications like additional classes, aliased mathematical functions and operations. It also provides a GUI for simple compilation of the programs written in processing.
- If you wish to run this on your system, please download latest version of Java Processing and install on your system.  
-You can modify things such as the speed of the game, the size of each cell and whether you want to see cricle or rectangle easily. Just play with the code and see changes in the output.
Open for feedback.
Thanks!
